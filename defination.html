At its simplest expression, a database is a gathering of information, here called data, stored on a server. The data is organized in a way it can easily be retrieved, managed and edited in significant ways by the end-user. The data could be something very simple such as personal information about clients or customers. It could also be inventory, sales, calls or anything anyone needs to track. It’s up to the user to determine what data needs to be aggregated and the format it will take.

When you’re using a database, the data is not stored on your computer’s hard drive but in the cloud on a server, somewhere. Using a database management system (DBMS), calls/queries are made to retrieve the information. This part is called the back-end. To present the data in a consequential way to the user, web developers create a web site and easy to use database applications. This part is called the front-end.

Even if there are many other database models such as hierarchical and network models, the relational database model is the most common. The relational database model was developed in the early 1970’s and it is still the most common model to this day. The data is stored in relations, taking the form of tables made of columns (fields) and rows (records/items). To access and interact with the data contained in a relational database, its user needs to use a relational database management system (RDBMS). The most common language used to query and manage relational databases is SQL (Structured Query Language).
